## Reflection

## Development

Per assignment instructions, I started from Frontend Mentor 'challenge' at http://frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca

## Resources

Used code I'd written in previous assignments, particularly Module 10 Skills Based Assessment.

Write a 200-300 word reflection discussing your development process, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and potential improvements.
Include this reflection in your GitHub repository.

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

For the icons, you can use a font icon library. Don't worry if the icons that you choose don't look exactly like they do on the design.

Some suggestions can be found below:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io)
- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com)
